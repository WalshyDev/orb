Orb supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 (QUIC). By default, it automatically negotiates the best available protocol.

## Protocol Versions

### HTTP/1.1

The classic HTTP protocol. Works over plain TCP or TLS.

```bash
orb --http1.1 https://example.com
```

### HTTP/2

Multiplexed connections over a single TCP connection. Requires TLS (HTTPS).

```bash
orb --http2 https://example.com
```

### HTTP/3

The newest protocol, using QUIC instead of TCP. Requires TLS (HTTPS) and server support.

```bash
orb --http3 https://example.com
```

<Aside type="note">
HTTP/3 requires the server to support QUIC. Many servers don't support it yet. If the server doesn't support HTTP/3, orb will fail with an error rather than falling back.

## Automatic Protocol Negotiation

Without forcing a specific version, orb negotiates the best protocol:

```bash
# HTTPS: Negotiates HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 via ALPN
orb https://example.com

# HTTP: Uses HTTP/1.1 (no negotiation)
orb http://example.com
```

The protocol is negotiated during TLS handshake using ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).

## Checking the Protocol Used

Use `-v` (verbose) to see which protocol was used:

```bash
orb -v https://example.com 2>&1 | grep -i "http/"
```

Output:
```
< HTTP/2 200 OK
```

Or with write-out:
```bash
orb -w https://example.com
```

## Protocol Requirements

| Protocol | Encryption | Transport |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| HTTP/1.1 | Optional | TCP |
| HTTP/2 | Required (HTTPS) | TCP |
| HTTP/3 | Required (HTTPS) | QUIC (UDP) |

<Aside type="caution">
Forcing HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 on a plain HTTP URL will fail. Always use HTTPS with these protocols.
