Orb supports automatic decompression of responses encoded with gzip, deflate, Brotli, and Zstandard.

## Automatic Decompression

Use `--compressed` to accept and automatically decompress compressed responses:

```bash
orb --compressed https://example.com
```

This sends the header:
```
Accept-Encoding: zstd, br, gzip, deflate
```

The server may respond with a compressed body, which orb automatically decompresses before output.

## Specific Compression Algorithm

Use `--compress-algo` to request a specific algorithm:

```bash
orb --compress-algo gzip https://example.com
```

Available algorithms:
- `gzip` - Most widely supported
- `deflate` - Legacy, widely supported
- `brotli` / `br` - Better compression, good support
- `zstd` - Best compression, growing support

<Aside type="note">
Servers are not required to honor your compression preference. The response may use any algorithm (or none).

## How Decompression Works

1. Orb sends `Accept-Encoding` header with supported algorithms
2. Server may respond with `Content-Encoding` header
3. Orb checks the header and decompresses accordingly
4. Decompressed content is written to output

```bash
# Request with verbose to see headers
orb -v --compressed https://example.com
```

```
> Accept-Encoding: zstd, br, gzip, deflate
< Content-Encoding: gzip
```
