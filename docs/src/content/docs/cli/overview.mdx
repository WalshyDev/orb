Orb is a modern HTTP client for the command line, designed as a powerful alternative to cURL. Built with Rust, it offers native support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC), and WebSockets.

## Basic Usage

```bash
orb [OPTIONS] <URL>
```

The only required argument is the URL. By default, orb makes a GET request and prints the response body to stdout.

```bash
orb https://api.example.com/users
```

## Key Features

- **Modern Protocols**: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 with automatic negotiation
- **WebSocket Support**: First-class WebSocket connections with interactive mode
- **cURL Compatibility**: Familiar options like `-H`, `-d`, `-X`, `-u`, `-o`
- **JSON Shorthand**: `--json` flag for easy JSON requests
- **Compression**: Built-in support for zstd, brotli, gzip, deflate
- **Progress Bar**: Automatic for large downloads
- **TLS/mTLS**: Full certificate support including client certificates

## Common Patterns

### API Requests

```bash
# GET with auth header
orb https://api.example.com/users -H "Authorization: Bearer token"

# POST JSON
orb https://api.example.com/users -X POST --json '{"name": "Alice"}'

# PUT with headers
orb https://api.example.com/users/1 \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Bob"}'
```

### Download Files

```bash
# Save to file
orb https://example.com/file.zip -o file.zip

# With progress bar
orb https://example.com/large-file.iso -o large-file.iso
```

### Debug Requests

```bash
# Show request/response headers
orb -v https://example.com

# Show timing statistics
orb -w https://example.com
```

### WebSockets

```bash
# Connect and send message
orb wss://echo.websocket.org --ws-message "Hello"

# Interactive mode
orb wss://echo.websocket.org
```

<Aside type="tip">
Use `-s` (silent mode) to suppress all output except errors. Useful for scripts that only care about exit codes.
