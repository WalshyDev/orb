import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Orb is designed as a modern alternative to cURL with a familiar command-line interface. This page compares the two tools.

## Feature Comparison

|---------|-----|------|
| HTTP/1.1 | ✓ | ✓ |
| HTTP/2 | ✓ | ✓ |
| HTTP/3 (QUIC) | ✓ | ✓ (experimental) |
| WebSocket | ✓ | ✗ |
| JSON shorthand | `--json` | Requires `-H` + `-d` |
| Compression | zstd, br, gzip, deflate | gzip, deflate, br |
| Progress bar | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cookie jar | ✓ | ✓ |

## Side-by-Side Examples

### Simple GET Request

```bash
# cURL
curl https://api.example.com/users

# Orb
orb https://api.example.com/users
```

### POST with JSON

```bash
# cURL
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice"}' \
  https://api.example.com/users

# Orb (simpler with --json)
orb -X POST --json '{"name": "Alice"}' https://api.example.com/users
```

### Custom Headers

```bash
# cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     https://api.example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    https://api.example.com
```

### Basic Authentication

```bash
# cURL
curl -u username:password https://api.example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb -u username:password https://api.example.com
```

### Bearer Token

```bash
# cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" https://api.example.com

# Orb (shorthand available)
orb --bearer token123 https://api.example.com
```

### File Upload

```bash
# cURL
curl -F "file=@photo.jpg" https://api.example.com/upload

# Orb (identical)
orb -F "file=@photo.jpg" https://api.example.com/upload
```

### Download to File

```bash
# cURL
curl -o file.zip https://example.com/file.zip

# Orb (identical)
orb -o file.zip https://example.com/file.zip
```

### Follow Redirects

```bash
# cURL
curl -L https://short.url/abc

# Orb (identical)
orb -L https://short.url/abc
```

### Verbose Output

```bash
# cURL
curl -v https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb -v https://example.com
```

### Headers Only

```bash
# cURL
curl -I https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb -I https://example.com
```

### Insecure (Skip TLS Verification)

```bash
# cURL
curl -k https://self-signed.example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb -k https://self-signed.example.com
```

### HTTP/2 Specific

```bash
# cURL
curl --http2 https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb --http2 https://example.com
```

### HTTP/3 Specific

```bash
# cURL
curl --http3 https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb --http3 https://example.com
```

### Compressed Response

```bash
# cURL
curl --compressed https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb --compressed https://example.com
```

### Timeout

```bash
# cURL
curl --connect-timeout 5 -m 30 https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb --connect-timeout 5 -m 30 https://example.com
```

### Cookie Jar

```bash
# cURL
curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb -b @cookies.txt -c cookies.txt https://example.com
```

<Aside type="note">
Orb uses `@` prefix for reading cookie files (`-b @cookies.txt`), while cURL doesn't require it (`-b cookies.txt`).
</Aside>

### Proxy

```bash
# cURL
curl -x http://proxy:8080 https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb -x http://proxy:8080 https://example.com
```

### DNS Override

```bash
# cURL
curl --connect-to example.com:443:localhost:8443 https://example.com

# Orb (identical)
orb --connect-to example.com:443:localhost:8443 https://example.com
```

## Orb-Only Features

### WebSocket Support

```bash
# Connect and send message
orb wss://echo.websocket.org --ws-message "Hello!"

# Interactive mode
orb wss://echo.websocket.org
```

cURL does not support WebSocket connections.

### Bearer Token Shorthand

```bash
# Orb
orb --bearer "your-token" https://api.example.com

# cURL equivalent
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" https://api.example.com
```

### JSON Shorthand

```bash
# Orb
orb --json '{"key": "value"}' https://api.example.com

# cURL equivalent
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}' https://api.example.com
```

## cURL-Only Features

Some cURL features not yet in orb:

- FTP, SFTP, SCP protocols (Will not be supported)
- TFTP, LDAP, DICT protocols (Will not be supported)
- Globbing/URL patterns (`[1-10]`, `{a,b,c}`)
- Config files (`.curlrc`)
- `--retry` with automatic backoff
- `--limit-rate` bandwidth throttling
- `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables

## Migration Tips

1. **Most options are identical** - Start by trying your cURL command with `orb` instead
2. **Use `--json` for JSON APIs** - Simpler than `-H "Content-Type: ..." -d ...`
3. **Use `--bearer` for tokens** - Cleaner than `-H "Authorization: ..."`
4. **WebSocket support** - Use `ws://` or `wss://` URLs directly

## When to Use Each

### Use Orb When

- You need WebSocket support
- You're working with modern HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 APIs
- You're workin with modern compression formats like zstd
- You prefer the `--json` and `--bearer` shortcuts

### Use cURL When

- You need FTP or other non-HTTP protocols
- You rely on URL globbing patterns
- You need specific cURL-only features
- Compatibility with existing scripts is critical
