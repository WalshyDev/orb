## Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform:

After downloading, move the binary to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin` on macOS/Linux.

## Command line Installation

After downloading, you'll need to make the binary executable and move it to your PATH:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    ```bash
    curl https://orb-tools.com/downloads/orb-macos -v -o orb
    chmod +x orb
    sudo mv orb /usr/local/bin/orb
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```bash
    curl https://orb-tools.com/downloads/orb-linux -v -o orb
    chmod +x orb
    sudo mv orb /usr/local/bin/orb
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://orb-tools.com/downloads/orb-windows.exe -OutFile orb.exe
    Move-Item orb.exe C:\Windows\System32\
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
