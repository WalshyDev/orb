## Your First Request

The simplest way to use orb is to pass a URL:

```bash
orb https://httpbin.org/get
```

This makes a GET request and prints the response body to stdout.

## Common Operations

### GET Request with Headers

```bash
orb https://api.example.com/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### POST with JSON Data

Use the `--json` flag to send JSON data (automatically sets `Content-Type: application/json`):

```bash
orb https://api.example.com/users \
  -X POST \
  --json '{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}'
```

### POST with Form Data

```bash
orb https://api.example.com/login \
  -X POST \
  -d "username=alice&password=secret"
```

### File Upload

Use `-F` for multipart form uploads:

```bash
orb https://api.example.com/upload \
  -X POST \
  -F "file=@/path/to/image.png" \
  -F "description=My image"
```

## Viewing Response Details

### Include Response Headers

Use `-i` to print response headers before the body:

```bash
orb -i https://httpbin.org/get
```

Output:
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: application/json
date: Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT

{
  "args": {},
  ...
}
```

### Headers Only

Use `-I` to only show headers (like a HEAD request):

```bash
orb -I https://example.com
```

### Verbose Mode

Use `-v` to see the full request/response exchange:

```bash
orb -v https://example.com
```

This shows:
- DNS resolution
- TLS handshake details
- Request headers sent
- Response headers received

## Authentication

### Basic Auth

```bash
orb -u username:password https://api.example.com/protected
```

### Bearer Token

```bash
orb --bearer "your-token-here" https://api.example.com/protected
```

## Following Redirects

By default, orb doesn't follow redirects. Use `-L` to follow them:

```bash
orb -L https://httpbin.org/redirect/3
```

## Saving Output to a File

```bash
orb https://example.com/file.zip -o downloaded.zip
```

For large downloads, orb automatically shows a progress bar.

## WebSocket Connections

Connect to a WebSocket server:

```bash
# Send a single message
orb wss://echo.websocket.org --ws-message "Hello!"

# Interactive mode (when TTY is available)
orb wss://echo.websocket.org
```

<Aside type="tip">
In interactive WebSocket mode, type messages and press Enter to send. Use Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D to disconnect.
</Aside>

## HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

Orb automatically negotiates the best protocol. To force a specific version:

```bash
# Force HTTP/1.1
orb --http1.1 https://example.com

# Force HTTP/2
orb --http2 https://example.com

# Force HTTP/3 (QUIC)
orb --http3 https://example.com
```

<Aside type="note">
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 require HTTPS. HTTP/3 also requires server support.
